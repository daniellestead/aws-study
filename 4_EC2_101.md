## EC2 101

EC2 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

Provides re-sizeable compute capacity in the cloud. Allows virtual machines to
be provisioned in the cloud within minutes.

Capacity can be both scaled up/down (changing instance types) as well as scaling
out (adding more instances).

#### Pricing options

* **On-demand** - allows you to pay a fixed price per hour (or second) with no
committment. Linux is by the second, whereas Windows in by the hour.
* **Reserved instances** - provides you with a capacity reservation and discounted
hourly rates, must be a 1-3 year contract though.
* **Spot** - enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity,
provided you can get that price.
* **Dedicated host** - physical EC2 server dedicated for your use.

#### Use cases

##### On demand
* Low cost and flexibility without up-front payment or long term committment.
* Apps with short term or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
* Apps being developed or tested on EC2 for the first time.

##### Reserved instances
* Apps with steady-state or predictable usage.
* Apps that require reserved capacity.
* Users can make up-front payments to reduce total compute costs.
  - Standard reserved instances - can be up to 75% off on-demand pricing.
  - Convertible reserved instances - can be up to 54% off on-demand pricing.
This option adds the flexibility of changing attributes of reserved instances as long as the
exchange creates reserved instances of equal or greater value.
  - Scheduled reserved instances - available to launch within the time frame
reserved.

##### Spot
* Apps that have flexible start and end times.
* Apps that are only feasible at very low compute prices.
* Users with an urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity.

##### Dedicated host
* Useful for regulatory requirements that might not support multi-tenant
virtualisation.
* Good for licensing that does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.
* Can be purchased on-demand (hourly).
* Can be purchased at a reservation at up to 70% off on-demand pricing.

#### EC2 instance types

analytics, real-time video processing, big data etc.
* **I3 - High speed storage** - NoSQL DBs, data warehousing etc.
* **G3 - Graphics intensive** - Video encoding, 3D app streaming.
* **H1 - High disk throughput** - Map-reduced based workloads, distributed file

* **T2 - Lower cost, general purpose** - Web servers, small DBs.
* **D2 - Dense storage** - File servers/data warehousing/hadoop.
* **R4 - Memory optimised** - Memory intensive apps/DBs.
* **M5 - General purpose** - Application servers.
* **C5 - Compute optimised** - CPU intensive apps/DBs.
* **P3 - Graphics/general purpose GPU** - Machine learning/bitcoin mining etc.
* **X1 - Memory optimised** - SAP HANA/Apache Spark etc.

#### Amazon EBS - Elastic Block Storage

EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances. Once
attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a
database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. EBS volumes
are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically
replicated to protect from the failure of a single component. Essentially just a
disk in the cloud that you can attach to your instances.

The EBS volume that is attached to your EC2 instance in called the **root device
volume** and other volumes can be on top of that.

##### EBS volume types

* General purpose SSD (GP2)
  - Balances both price and performance.
  - Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10,000 IPOS and the ability to burst up
to 3,000 IPOS for extended periods of time with volumes > 3334 GB.
* Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
  - Designed for I/O intensive apps such as large relational DBs or NoSQL DBs.
  - Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS.
  - Can provision up to 20,000 IOPS per volume.
* Throughput optimised HDD (ST1)
  - Big data.
  - Data warehousing.
  - Log processing.
  - Cannot be a root device volume.
* Cold HDD (SC1)
  - Lowest cost storage for infrequently accessed workloads.
  - File server.
  - Cannot be a root device volume.
* Magnetic (Standard)
  - Lowest cost per GB for all bootable EBS volume types. Ideal for workloads
that are accessed infrequently and apps where lowest cost storage is important.

#### Exam tips

* Remember pricing options!
* If a spot instance is terminated by Amazon, you will not be charged for a
partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will
be charged for the whole hour.
* Remember different EBS types!
