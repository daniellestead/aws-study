## RDS 101

#### What is RDS?
Relational database server

#### Relational database types
* SQL server
* Oracle
* MySQL server
* PostgreSQL
* Aurora
* MariaDB

#### Non-relational databases
Database:
  - Collection (~table)
  - Document (~row)
  - Key value pairs (~fields)

Don't need to predefine columns.
E.G:

```
{
  "_id" : "512",
  "firstname" : "John",
  "address" : [
    {"street" : "21 Jump St",
     "suburb" : "Richmond"}
              ]
}
```

#### OLTP vs OLAP
Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) differs from Online Analytics
Processing (OLAP) in terms of the types of queries run.

OLTP example:
Order number 201 pulls up row of data such as name, date, address etc.

OLAP example:
Net profit for product. Requires doing sums and operations on data. Harder
queries to run require specialised infrastructure.

#### Elasticache
Elasticache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate and scale an
in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web apps
by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches,
instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based drives.

Elasticache supports two open source in-memory caching engines:
* Memcached
* Redis

#### Summary types
* RDS - OLTP
* DynamoDB - NoSQL
* Redshift - OLAP
* Elasticache
