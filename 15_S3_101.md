## S3 101

#### What is S3?
Secure, durable, highly scalable object storage.

* Stores files from 0 bytes to 5TB.
* Unlimited storage \.
* Stored in buckets.
* Universal namespace, so names must be unique globally.
* When you upload to S3, you will receive an HTTP 200 code if the upload was
successful (only is using API or CLI).

#### Data consistency model
* 'Read after write' consistency for PUTS of new objects.
* 'Eventual consistency' for overwrite PUTS and DELETES

#### S3 is a simple key-value store

Objects consist of:
* Key (name of the object)
* Value (the data, made up of a sequence of bytes)
* Version ID
* Metadata (data about the data)
* Sub-resources - bucket specific config:
  - bucket policies, access control lists
  - cross origin resource sharing
  - transfer acceleration

* Built for 99.99% availability for S3 platform
* AWS guarantees 99.9% availability
* AWS guarantees 99.999999999% durability for S3 ~ amount of data you can expect
to lose over a given year, so if you stored 10,000,000,000 objects in S3 you
could expect to lose an average of a single object once every 10,000 years
* Tiered storage available
* Lifecycle management
* Versioning
* Encryption
* Access control lists and bucket policies

#### Storage tiers/classes

* S3
  - All the availability and durability
  - Stores data redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities  
  - Designed to sustain loss of 2 facilities concurrently

* S3 - IA (Infrequently accessed)
  - For data accessed less frequently but still requires rapid access when
needed
  - Charged lower fee but *also a retrieval fee*.

* S3 One Zone IA
  - Same as IA but data is only stored in a single availability zone
  - Still 99.999999999% durable, but only 99.5% availability
  - Costs 20% less than IA

* Reduced redundancy storage
  - Designed to provide 99.99% availability and durability
  - Good for data that can be recreated when lost
  - Not offered in some regions
  - Not recommended

* Glacier
  - Very cheap
  - Used for archiving only
  - Designed for very infrequently accessed data
  - Takes 3 - 5 hours to restore from Glacier (no real time access)

#### Charges
* Storage per GB
* Number of requests (GET, PUT, COPY etc)
* Storage management (inventory, analytics, object tags)
* Data management pricing (data transferred out of S3)
* Transfer acceleration (uses CloudFront to optimise transfers)

#### Exam tips
* Not suitable to install operating system or run DB on.
* Stores object from 0 B to 5 TB.
* Unlimited storage.
* Files stored in buckets.
* Universal namespace.
* Data consistency models.
