## IAM Summary

IAM consists of:

* Users 
* Groups
* Roles
* Policy documents

#### Things we have learned

* Identity access management is **universal** so it is the same regardless of region.
* The 'root account' is the account created when you first set up your AWS account. It has complete admin access.
* New users have **no permissions** when they are first created.
* New users are assigned the access key ID and secret access key when they are created. This can only be viewed once.
* Always set up MFA on the root account.
* You can create and customise your own password rotation policies.
