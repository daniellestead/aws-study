## Step Functions

Step functions allow you to visualise and test serverless applications. They provide a graphical console to arrange an visualise component of the app as a series of steps, which makes it simple to build and run multi step apps. A bit like DAGS actually.

- Uses Amazons State Language.

Types:
- Sequential steps - like a linear DAG.
- Branching steps - more like a complicated DAG, with different options.
- Parallel steps - like sequential, but a few tasks in parallel.

For exam, just need to know what Step Functions is. This service is under Application Integration.
