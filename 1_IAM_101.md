#### What does IAM give you?

* Centralised control of AWS account.
* Shared access to AWS account.
* Granular permissions (*different levels of access*).
* Identity Federation (*ie. Active Directory, Facebook, LinkedIn etc*).
* Multi-factor authentication.
* Provides temporary access for users/devices and services.
* Allows you to set up your own password rotation policy.
* Integrates with many different AWS services.
* Supports PCI DSS compliance.

#### Critical terms

* **Users** - End users.
* **Groups** - A collection of users grouped by a set of permissions.
* **Roles** - Roles can be assigned to AWS resources. For example, if you had an EC2 instance you wanted to access files in an S3 bucket, that can be done using a role.
* **Policy** - A document that defines either one or more permissions. Can be attached to either a user, group or role. The user, group or role will then have the permissions defined by that policy. It is possible to have a user, group and role share the same policy.
